<p>Dark forest space is vast. But I didn’t know that at first, busy as I was, claiming all celestial bodies in sight. But space had a way of quickly teaching you its lessons. <!--more--></p>

<p>The first issue I ran into was the fog of war. With my laptop’s paltry 600 hashes/sec, I quickly ran out of planets to claim. I had to find a way to increase my exploration speed. The easiest solution was to let dark forest use all the cores in my CPU with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">df.setMinerCores(6)</code>, which gave me a nice 6x boost to 2400 hashes/sec. But even that was not sufficient, so I set up a more efficient rust miner on my machine with <a href="https://github.com/projectsophon/darkforest-rs/tree/main/mimc-fast">mimi-fast</a> and <a href="https://github.com/darkforest-eth/plugins/tree/master/content/productivity/remote-explore">remote explore</a>, which brought me to a nice 6000 hashes/sec. This gave me far more planets in view than I knew what to do with, which is what lead me to the <a href="https://github.com/darkforest-eth/plugins/blob/master/content/productivity/crawl-planets/plugin.js">crawl planets plugin</a>. It’s not very smart, but sure helps cover ground quickly.</p>

<p>Thanks to increased speed, it took no time for me to run into my two neighbours: jimjim_eth in yellow and 0xe98 in purple. Jimjim controls few astral bodies, but they’re all highly valuable. 0xe98 is the opposite: controlling everything in his sector, indiscriminate of value, most likely through the use of the same crawler I’m using. I can tell because the shape of his holding looks much like mine.</p>

<p>At first, I was threatened by the discovery of two neighbouring civilizations so close by, but after examining their silver withdrawals on the global leaderboard, I was reassured to find that they were roughly in the same order of magnitude in power as me. I have no desire to fight them, but if I had to, I’m comforted by the thought that it wouldn’t be completely one-sided.</p>

<p>With my growing holdings (which I refuse to call an empire, because my people deserve a better governance system, but that’s for later), it’s becoming more difficult to efficiently funnel my silver to space-time tears. I could try to set up a transfer routine, but that won’t get me too much further. And unfortunately, there’s no “withdraw silver plugin”, so that leaves me with no choice but to write my own.</p>

<p>If my neighbours don’t destroy me between now and the next log, these will be my action items:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write an auto silver withdrawal plugin</li>
  <li>Increase my exploration hash rate with a remote server.</li>
</ol>

<p>Captain Zhang, signing off. See you all in the <a href="zkga.me">Dark Forest</a>.</p>
