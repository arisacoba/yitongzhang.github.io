Sprout Design Challenge

# Challenge
Help new customers choose the Sprout Social plan that best suits their needs.

# Self-challenge
Make this more useful than just showing all the options at once

Problems right now: 
- hard constraints of the plans not obvious
- hard to see the feature differences at a glance
- pricing formula changes for t8eam
- hard to compare on mobile

# Considerations 
* In line with current Sprout brand
* CSS has reusable styles
* Proper HTML form
* Implement form best UX
** Use correct input method
** Use good defaults
** Same page filter/result for instant feedback?

# Research questions
## Job description
* increase brand awareness and adoption
* engage user base 
* it’s where we talk to users. we don’t have press release.
## How does tool buying work?
* Large companies usually have purchasing department with a pre-approved vendor list. Changing tools is usually a really big deal with a lot of organizational change. They expect a rep from the company to be there to help them navigate the change → hence, talk to a person option.
* Small teams usually can decide on their own, will more likely evaluate feature set.
## How are social media teams organized?
* Usually, 1-5 people. 
* Composition: 1-2 SM managers, 1-2 content people (sometimes from agency), 1-3 leadership people
* Each SM manager does at least 6 channels.
* Sometimes, external agencies do the actual production work and data analyses. Internal folks take that data and think about overall brand strategy

## Best-practice research
* For choices where any could work and it really depends on what your prefs are, a questionnaire is better


# Prototype questions
## Button form vs paragraph form?
* Button: speed and better UX (fewer clicks, less thinking from user)
* Paragraph: gives context
## Where to place the widget?
* next to existing CTA
* on the pricing page
## Whether to transition to a new page to show plan
* same page: instant feedback
* next page: start the funnel
## Show all plans with highlight vs just the right one

## Slider vs buttons
No slider: 
- Slider needs precise value. People don’t know how precisely the follower amount, just the range.
- Social profile: people have to count the amount. don’t know the precise number off hand
