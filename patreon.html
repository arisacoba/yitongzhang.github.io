							<p>Hey Patreon team,</p>

							<p>I’m an ex-founder on the hunt for a new challenge. When I came across the Creator Discovery role at Patreon, I stopped dead in my tracks. This role fits perfectly with my desire to help artist and my background in sales.</p>

							<p>With my experience in pitching to customers, employees and investors, I’ll do great in this position. In fact, you’ll find that:</p>

							<p>1. I can pull in the numbers. In 3 months, I closed 15 B2B deals for my company, got a term sheet from 500 Startups and recruited 70+ contractors. While doing this, I found ways to make every person I talked to feel individually cared for.</p>

							<p>2. I care deeply about the success of our customers. To help users integrate Hemingly, we learned their business inside out. We knew exactly what they needed and why they needed it.  When our contractors were late, we pulled all nighters so our customers wouldn’t be impacted. And when we finally shut down, we called all our customers and individually found them replacement services. </p>

							<p>My very first company also tried to help creatives make a living. Although we had to pivot away to find success, I’m still deeply attached to this issue. Seeing Patreon help over 17,000 creatives make a salary really excites me and I would love to join you in bringing the platform to even more artists.</p>

							<p>Can’t wait to hear back from you guys,</p>

							<p>Yitong</p>
