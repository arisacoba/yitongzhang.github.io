5<p>With the right background, enough commitment, and a bit of luck, it is possible to functionally get a greencard in under a year with the EB1.
I recently went through the process, so I’m documenting how it works and sharing some lessons I’ve learned. <!--more--> My own journey started when I read a similar blog post by <a href="julian.com">Julian Shapiro</a> almost three years ago, so it’s only fair to pay it forward.</p>

<p>I have a lot of feelings about the way immigration works in this country, but I’ll be saving those for the next posts, where I’ll go more in depth about the price we all pay for the bad employment policy, and some ideas on how to fix it. If you’d like to get an email when that comes out, consider subscribing via email or RSS.</p>

<p>Before we get further, you should know I’m not a lawyer, though I’ve worked at length with three immigration law firms, have personally immigrated twice, and talk often with friends in similar situations. If you are seriously considering going through with an EB-1, I advise you consult a lawyer.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-eb1">What’s the EB1?</h2>
<p>Often referred to as the “extraordinary talent” or “Employment-based, first preference”, the EB1 greencard is very fast, and does not require employer sponsorship. On the flip side, it is also the most effortful to get, due to the high bar one needs to meet. As a result, it’s generally most interresting to professionally accomplished Indian or Chinese nationals who might otherwise have to wait up to 10 years, or any person who wants to avoid being tied to a sponsoring employer.</p>

<h2 id="eligibility-criteria">Eligibility criteria</h2>
<p>In order to qualify for an EB1 greencard, applicants must satisfy at least three of the following ten criteria. Though this list might seem daunting, most decently successful and well-connected professional can reasonably build up the evidence given enough time and will.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Evidence of receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence</li>
  <li>Evidence of your membership in associations in the field which demand outstanding achievement of their members</li>
  <li>Evidence of published material about you in professional or major trade publications or other major media</li>
  <li>Evidence that you have been asked to judge the work of others, either individually or on a panel</li>
  <li>Evidence of your original scientific, scholarly, artistic, athletic, or business-related contributions of major significance to the field</li>
  <li>Evidence of your authorship of scholarly articles in professional or major trade publications or other major media</li>
  <li>Evidence that your work has been displayed at artistic exhibitions or showcases</li>
  <li>Evidence of your performance of a leading or critical role in distinguished organizations</li>
  <li>Evidence that you command a high salary or other significantly high remuneration in relation to others in the field</li>
  <li>Evidence of your commercial successes in the performing arts</li>
</ol>

<p>For me, it took on the order of a few hundred hours to establish the necessary evidence. It was by no means easy, but since most of these criteria are generally aligned with a successful career, the time spent was rarely wasted, even if I were to fail to get a greencard. It is also possible, though rare, to instead demonstrate a single major international achievement on the magnitude of a Nobel prize, Fields medal, Oscar, Grammy, etc.</p>

<p>For each of these criteria, applicants use a combination of letters from authoritative figures and objective documentatary evidence, which is what the USCIS likes to call facts, to demonstrate their eligibility. An adjudicator at USCIS then evaluates the evidences in a two step process: first ensuring that each criteria has been met, then evaluating the sum of all evidence against the bar for extraordinary achievement. At the end of the evaluation, they will issue either a pass, a request for evidence (RFE for short), or a denial (rare). The most common outcome is an RFE, where specific additional detail will be demanded from the applicant. Successfully meeting this request results in a pass. Failure results in a denial. Note that denials are not final, as applicants can refile as many time as they want.</p>

<h2 id="my-application">My application</h2>
<p>For background, I am a Canadian citizen born in China. For the last six years, I’ve been a product designer working for tech companies in the San Francisco bay area.</p>

<p><strong>Judging the work of others</strong>
The applicant judged five university hackathons. Two hackathon organizers issued letters detailing the merits on which the applicant was selected as a judge, as well as a list of other judges, which included executives of well-known companies, professors, and public figures. Evidence also included screenshots of various events showing the full list of judges.</p>

<p>Outcome: The adjudicator accepted this criterion.</p>

<p><strong>Original business-related contributions of major significance</strong>
The applicant created a free software plugin that is popular within their field, and used by teams at well-known companies. The package included install statistics (more than 100k times), and a letter from the CEO of the company that makes the software for which the plugin was written, speaking to its importance. Screenshots from blogs discussing and featuring the plugin were also submitted.</p>

<p>Outcome: This criterion received an RFE requesting proof of the plugin’s significance. In response, the applicant submitted a clarifying letter from the same CEO with additonal statistics, as well as six letters from designers at well-known companies attesting to their use of the plugin and its impact. [insert outcome]</p>

<p><strong>Performance of a leading or critical role in distinguished organizations</strong>
The applicant played critical roles in several major projects for his current employer, as well as his past one. Evidence incliudes: a letter from the CEO of his current company, letters from a product manager and design executive from clients of his previous explorer.</p>

<p>Outcome: his criterion received an RFE requesting proof that the impact of the applicant’s role on the whole company and how it was beyond the scope of his normal work. The applicant supplied additional letters from senior executives addressing these questions. The applicant also challenged the necessity to demonstrate the criteria.</p>

<p><strong>High salary or other significantly high remuneration in relation to others in the field</strong>
The applicant makes $230k a year, which is x% above the median for designers in the united states, demonstrated through sceenshots of salary data from glassdoor (?) and the applicant’s paystubs (?).</p>

<p>Outcome: This criterion received an RFE for the applicant’s W2s. [insert outcome here]</p>

<h3 id="authorship-of-scholarly-articles-in-professional-or-major-trade-publications-or-other-major-media">Authorship of scholarly articles in professional or major trade publications or other major media</h3>
<p>The applicant spoke at a mix of podcast, local, and online events, both individually and as part of a panel. Screenshots of all the event websites were provided along with a letter from a professor of design stating how in this field, speaking at events is considered to be major media on the same level as journal publication.</p>

<h2 id="outcome-this-criterion-received-an-rfe-requesting-">Outcome: This criterion received an RFE requesting (?)</h2>
<p>For another <a href="https://www.tefter.io/bookmarks/48931/readable">good example</a> check out Julian’s site.</p>

<h1 id="timeline">Timeline</h1>

<p>The theoretical fastest possible timeline:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 month to gather evidence, get medical exam, and prepare the I-140, I-485, I-131 and I-765</li>
  <li>0.5 months to hear back from USCIS</li>
  <li>6-9 months to receive employment authorization documents &amp; travel authorization, which combined together gives you functionally a greencard</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="get-supporting-letters">Get supporting letters</h2>
<p>The applicant builds evidence and gets support letter demonstrating how they meet at least three of the ten EB1 criteria</p>

<p>Typically takes: 2–4 months
Outcome: Applicant has strong evidence and support letters.</p>

<h2 id="submit-application-i-140">Submit application (I-140)</h2>
<p>Evidence and supporting letters are mailed into USCIS, along with a filled out form I-140. This is the official greencard application.</p>

<p>Approval time: 3-6 months(?). Applicants can pay $1,500 for a 15 day response. This is called premium processing.
Outcome: Greencard application is either accepted, RFE’ed or rejected</p>

<h2 id="respond-to-rfe-optional">Respond to RFE (optional)</h2>
<p>If your application receives a request for evidence, you have three months (?) to brind additional document and/or objections.</p>

<p>Approval time: (?). 15 days if premium processing was purchased.
Outcome: Greencard application is either accepted or rejected</p>

<h2 id="submit-adjustmnet-of-status-i-485">Submit adjustmnet of status (I-485)</h2>
<p>If an application is accepted and if the applicant’s country’s date of filing (?) is current, the applicant can now file a request to change their status to a permanent resident via form I-485.</p>

<p>To get the green card faster, applicants can file the I-485 before their I-140 is accepted, with the risk of wasting money and effort should the latter be rejected.</p>

<p>Approval time: Depends on which USCIS service center you applied with
Outcome: Receive greencard.</p>

<h2 id="apply-for-travel-document-and-employment-authorization-i-131-and-i-765">Apply for travel document and employment authorization (I-131 and I-765)</h2>
<p>Because it can take a long time for an ajustment of status to get approved, people usually concurrently apply for travel docuemnt and employment authorization at the same time. These documents are faster to get, and when combined together, provide almost all the benefits of holding a greencard – providing the freedom while you wait for I-485 approval.</p>

<p>Approval time: Depends on which USCIS service center you applied with
Outcome: Be able to travel freely and work for whoever you want</p>

<h1 id="advice">Advice</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Generally it is better to put on a strong showing for fewer (typically four or five) criteria, than trying to do more but less well.</li>
  <li>If you have a previously accepted I-140 from a lower preference (EB2 or EB3), you can use that date to accelerate your EB1 if your country is not current.</li>
  <li>It really helps to have access to famous people: senior executives, well-known professionals in your field, professors, public figures, etc. Cultivate these relationships early.</li>
  <li>If you don’t already clearly meet these criteria, plan for one to two years to go meet them.</li>
  <li>Get your letters on official letterhead, even if it’s not technically required. It can be a cause of RFE. In a pinch a “personal” letterhead could do.</li>
  <li>If your EB1 is approved, this means you’re almost guaranteed to also get approved for the O1 visa, which can be convenient if you need to work in the US while your greencard is processing.</li>
  <li>For people who are very likely to agree to signing a lettr, it is better to pre-write the lettter for them before you even ask if they want to do it. This way, you can immediately give them something to sign once they agree, saving yourself the back and forth from your lead going cold while your legal team works on the letter. You’ll be getting a lot of letters, so this adds up.</li>
  <li>On non-immigrant visas like the TN, it is inadvisable to leave the country from the day you submit your application until you get your travel authorization, even if your application is accepted. This could last anywhere from 6–8 months. You should plan ahead for this.</li>
  <li>The country of the greencard applicant is not based on their citizenship, but place of birth. A British citizen born in India is Indian from this perspective.</li>
  <li>Spouses also get a greencard if you file together (?)</li>
  <li>When challenging an RFE, it is best to also respond to the request, even if unreasonable, as a show of good faith.</li>
  <li>USCIS publishes a <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-2#footnote-4">policy manual</a> with detailed explanation of how adjudicatprs should think about EB1 eligibility, and references specific articles of law. It’s helpful further reading.</li>

<p>This is part one of two posts I’m writing on immigration. In this first part, I’m going do my best to document what it was like to apply for an employment-based green card in the most clear and helpful way I can, and share the lessons I’ve learned along the way. My own process started when I read a similar blog post by Julian almost three years ago, so I’m trying to pay this forward.</p>

<p>I have a lot of feelings about this process, but I’ll be saving those for the second part, where I’ll go more in depth about the price we all pay for the bad employment policy, and what we can do to fix this.</p>
