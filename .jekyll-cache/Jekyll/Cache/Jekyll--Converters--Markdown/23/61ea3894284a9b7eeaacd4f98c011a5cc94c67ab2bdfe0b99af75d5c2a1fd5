I"—<p>This is a grab bag of tensions I wrestle with. Probably not that interesting, but I think about them often enough that they‚Äôre worth writing down.<!--more--></p>

<p><em>Agency vs determinism</em></p>

<p>If you zoom out, a lot of arguments around questions of redistribution and fairness often boil down to a debate around how much an individual‚Äôs actions are their own vs determined by cicumstances outside of their control. On a smaller scale, I find myself often struggling to find the right balance between believing in my ability to enact change (which is often followed by blaming myself for failing) and cutting myself some slack ‚Äì like maybe this one isn‚Äôt meant to be? (which then triggers feeling like I am just a passenger in my own life.).</p>

<p>When I was younger, I was wa all-in on individual agency, which I think I picked up from reading too many young adult novels. Through them, I came to belive that anything could happen if you only wanted it enough. Though naive, my belief in self-determination made me almost totally unflappable. I came to construe most events in my life as a result of effort. Everything had meaning. Every effect had a cause within my control.</p>

<p>Then as I got older, I‚Äôve come to understand that causation for most things are murky at best. Looking back at my now much longer record of decisions, I can see that many forks that could have gone either way are now major determinants of my life. In others, I‚Äôve come to see how early circumstances can ripple through one‚Äôs life in great and terrible ways. I mean, how can you believe in self-determination when simply drinking too much water from lead pipes can change a child‚Äôs personality?</p>

<p>So here‚Äôs where I am on this today: on an individual level, I think of it a little like diving. When you‚Äôre in it, you hold your breadth and act with full agency, but when you come up for air, you accept that life does not bend itself to your will.</p>

<p><em>Small vs strong self</em></p>

<p>One tenet of modern therapy is the concept of a small self, which is when you try to minimize what you consider, well, ‚Äúyou‚Äù. Your thoughts are not you. Your job is not you. Your passions are not you. You are the thing experiencing all these things.</p>

<p>The smaller your self is, the more resilient you are. It‚Äôs easier differentiate having negative thoughts from believing and being those thoughts, easier to shed bad habits when they do not define you, easier to change course when a temporary injury becomes permanent, easier to reinvent yourself over and over again.</p>

<p>But in my experience, it is also helpful to have a strong sense of self. When you know what you want, life sort of just lines up: you experience less FOMO, have more time to do what you want, and are more present when doing them.</p>

<p>So how do you both have a small and strong self? For me, it goes back to that old clich√© of ‚Äústrong beliefs, losely held‚Äù. Applied to selfhood, this means being able to simultaneously strongly express and quickly shed identities. It‚Äôs hard when you have to constantly explain the change to your friends, and especially hard when you discover self-perceptions that you didn‚Äôt even know you had until you tried to shed them.</p>
