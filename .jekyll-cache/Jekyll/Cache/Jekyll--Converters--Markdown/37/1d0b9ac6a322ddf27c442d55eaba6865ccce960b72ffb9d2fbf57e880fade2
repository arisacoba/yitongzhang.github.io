I"E<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Yitong, a designer in San Francisco. I grew up in Canada ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦, where our family moved when I was young.</p>

<p>I work at Coinbase as a designer, currently on design systems. I also designed a bunch of the consumer app (the blue one that most people use).</p>

<p>In my spare time, I like making things.</p>
