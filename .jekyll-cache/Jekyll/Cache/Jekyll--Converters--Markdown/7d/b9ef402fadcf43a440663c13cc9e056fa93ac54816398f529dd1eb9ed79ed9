I"7<p>Hi! I’m Yitong, a designer in San Francisco. I grew up in Montreal, Canada – a very cold place my family moved to when I was young. Immigration is a big part of my story. You can listen to me talk about it on <a href="https://designdetails.fm/episodes/1xROYMXj">Design Details</a>.</p>

<p>I currently work on design systems at <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>. I also designed a bunch of the consumer app aka the blue one that most people use.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I like to make things like this Figma plugin called <a href="https://www.flowchart.design/">Autoflow</a>, or this marketing page pattern library called <a href="http://goodweb.design/">Goodweb.design</a>, and this vegetable seasonality <a href="http://howfresh.co/">website</a>. The latter really needs a bit of maintenance</p>
