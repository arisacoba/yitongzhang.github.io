I",<p><a href="zkga.me">Dark forest</a> space is vast. At first, I transfered energy from planet to planet, claiming all celestial bodies within my exlorer’s sight.</p>

<p>In the depths of space, I met my two neighbours: jimjim_eth in yellow and 0xe985cb1f0a06ec400a3d4fcdb4b1eee9d01c3f9c in purple, the latter of whom will henceforth be knwon as 0xe98 for short. Jimjim controls few astral bodies, but they’re all highly valuable. 0xe98</p>

<p>You can tell who’s been using the crawl planets plugin from the shape of their planet constellations.</p>
