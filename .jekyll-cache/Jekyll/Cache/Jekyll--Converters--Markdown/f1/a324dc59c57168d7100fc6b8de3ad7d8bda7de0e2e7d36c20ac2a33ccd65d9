I"ö6<p>With the right background, enough commitment, and a bit of luck, it is possible to functionally get a greencard in under a year with the EB1.
I recently went through the process, so I‚Äôm documenting how it works and sharing some lessons I‚Äôve learned. <!--more--> My own journey started when I read a similar blog post by <a href="julian.com">Julian Shapiro</a> almost three years ago, so it‚Äôs only fair to pay it forward.</p>

<p>I have a lot of feelings about the way immigration works in this country, but I‚Äôll be saving those for the next posts, where I‚Äôll go more in depth about the price we all pay for the bad employment policy, and some ideas on how to fix it. If you‚Äôd like to get an email when that comes out, consider subscribing via email or RSS.</p>

<p>Before we get further, you should know I‚Äôm not a lawyer, though I‚Äôve worked at length with three immigration law firms, have personally immigrated twice, and talk often with friends in similar situations. If you are seriously considering going through with an EB-1, I advise you consult a lawyer.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-eb1">What‚Äôs the EB1?</h2>
<p>Often referred to as the ‚Äúextraordinary talent‚Äù or ‚ÄúEmployment-based, first preference‚Äù, the EB1 greencard is very fast, and does not require employer sponsorship. On the flip side, it is also the most effortful to get, due to the high bar one needs to meet. As a result, it‚Äôs generally most interresting to professionally accomplished Indian or Chinese nationals who might otherwise have to wait up to 10 years, or any person who wants to avoid being tied to a sponsoring employer.</p>

<h2 id="eligibility-criteria">Eligibility criteria</h2>
<p>In order to qualify for an EB1 greencard, applicants must satisfy at least three of the following ten criteria. Though this list might seem daunting, most decently successful and well-connected professional can reasonably build up the evidence given enough time and will.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Evidence of receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence</li>
  <li>Evidence of your membership in associations in the field which demand outstanding achievement of their members</li>
  <li>Evidence of published material about you in professional or major trade publications or other major media</li>
  <li>Evidence that you have been asked to judge the work of others, either individually or on a panel</li>
  <li>Evidence of your original scientific, scholarly, artistic, athletic, or business-related contributions of major significance to the field</li>
  <li>Evidence of your authorship of scholarly articles in professional or major trade publications or other major media</li>
  <li>Evidence that your work has been displayed at artistic exhibitions or showcases</li>
  <li>Evidence of your performance of a leading or critical role in distinguished organizations</li>
  <li>Evidence that you command a high salary or other significantly high remuneration in relation to others in the field</li>
  <li>Evidence of your commercial successes in the performing arts</li>
</ol>

<p>For me, it took on the order of a few hundred hours to establish the necessary evidence. It was by no means easy, but since most of these criteria are generally aligned with a successful career, the time spent was rarely wasted, even if I were to fail to get a greencard. It is also possible, though rare, to instead demonstrate a single major international achievement on the magnitude of a Nobel prize, Fields medal, Oscar, Grammy, etc.</p>

<p>For each of these criteria, applicants use a combination of letters from authoritative figures and objective documentatary evidence, which is what the USCIS likes to call facts, to demonstrate their eligibility. An adjudicator at USCIS then evaluates the evidences in a two step process: first ensuring that each criteria has been met, then evaluating the sum of all evidence against the bar for extraordinary achievement in a process called the final merits determination. At the end of the evaluation, they will issue either a pass, a request for evidence (RFE for short), or a denial (rare). The most common outcome is an RFE, where specific additional detail will be demanded from the applicant. Successfully meeting this request results in a pass. Failure results in a denial, though denials are not final, as applicants can refile as many time as they want.</p>

<h2 id="my-application">My application</h2>
<p>Though every application is unique, I‚Äôm sharing mine here so that it may act as a data point when you consider whether the EB1 is for you. For background, I am a Canadian citizen born in China. For the last six years, I‚Äôve been a product designer working for tech companies in the San Francisco bay area. I submitted my application based on the following five criteria. While only three are necessary, most people submit an extra one or two just to be safe. For another <a href="https://www.tefter.io/bookmarks/48931/readable">good example</a>, check out Julian‚Äôs post.</p>

<h3 id="original-business-related-contributions-of-major-significance">Original business-related contributions of major significance</h3>
<p>My contribution to the field was the creation of a popular Figma plugin called <a href="flowchart.plugin">Autoflow</a>. At the time of application, it had been installed more than 250,000 times and was used by teams at large well-known companies. I was lucky to have met Dylan Field, the CEO of Figma, at an event at a time when they happened to be opening up the plugin program to alpha developers and managed to become one of the launch plugins six months later, leading to a ton of organic growth. The supporting evidence in my package included install and usage statistics, and a letter from the CEO of Figma speaking to its importance, and creenshots from blogs discussing the plugin.</p>

<h3 id="performance-of-a-critical-role-in-distinguished-organizations">Performance of a critical role in distinguished organizations</h3>
<p>In my day job, I‚Äôve lead the design of several high profile projects at Coinbase, most notably the rewrite and redesign of both mobile applications. We also included several projects I‚Äôve been a small contributor to as a contractor at Google (like Soli and Grasshopper). The finanl evidence includes: a letter from the CEO of Coinbase, and letters from a product manager and design executive at Google.</p>

<h3 id="high-remuneration-in-relation-to-others-in-the-field">High remuneration in relation to others in the field</h3>
<p>Thanks to the recent Coinbase IPO and generally competitive bay area tech designer salaries, we were able to demonstrate that I was paid well above the average of my field by drawing comparisons to several salary aggregator websites like Glassdoor.</p>

<h3 id="judging-the-work-of-others">Judging the work of others</h3>
<p>I judged five university hackathons. Two hackathon organizers issued letters detailing the merits on which the applicant was selected as a judge, as well as a list of other judges, which included executives of well-known companies, professors, and public figures. This criteria seems generally prettty easy to hit as it‚Äôs worded fairly generously, though meeting the strict minimum like I did might not contribute as much to your final merits.</p>

<h3 id="authorship-of-articles-in-professional-or-major-publications">Authorship of articles in professional or major publications</h3>
<p>I spoke in a mix of podcast, local, and online events, both individually and as part of a panel. Though the criteria technically asked for scholarly artickes, we figured that if we can get a reputable academic (we got a VC and lecturer at the stanford D.school) to say how the product design field shares professional findings in podcasst and talks instead of journals, that we can make my public appearances count.</p>

<h2 id="responding-to-rfes-and-denials">Responding to RFEs and denials</h2>
<p>Like many applicants in the post 2016 era, my application was met with an RFE, which requested more information for a few criteria we submitted.</p>

<p>Outcome: This criterion received an RFE requesting (?)</p>

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>

<p>The theoretical fastest possible timeline:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 month to gather evidence, get medical exam, and prepare the I-140, I-485, I-131 and I-765</li>
  <li>0.5 months to hear back from USCIS</li>
  <li>6-9 months to receive employment authorization documents &amp; travel authorization, which combined together gives you functionally a greencard</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="get-supporting-letters">Get supporting letters</h2>
<p>The applicant builds evidence and gets support letter demonstrating how they meet at least three of the ten EB1 criteria</p>

<p>Typically takes: 2‚Äì4 months
Outcome: Applicant has strong evidence and support letters.</p>

<h2 id="submit-application-i-140">Submit application (I-140)</h2>
<p>Evidence and supporting letters are mailed into USCIS, along with a filled out form I-140. This is the official greencard application.</p>

<p>Approval time: 3-6 months(?). Applicants can pay $1,500 for a 15 day response. This is called premium processing.
Outcome: Greencard application is either accepted, RFE‚Äôed or rejected</p>

<h2 id="respond-to-rfe-optional">Respond to RFE (optional)</h2>
<p>If your application receives a request for evidence, you have three months (?) to brind additional document and/or objections.</p>

<p>Approval time: (?). 15 days if premium processing was purchased.
Outcome: Greencard application is either accepted or rejected</p>

<h2 id="submit-adjustmnet-of-status-i-485">Submit adjustmnet of status (I-485)</h2>
<p>If an application is accepted and if the applicant‚Äôs country‚Äôs date of filing (?) is current, the applicant can now file a request to change their status to a permanent resident via form I-485.</p>

<p>To get the green card faster, applicants can file the I-485 before their I-140 is accepted, with the risk of wasting money and effort should the latter be rejected.</p>

<p>Approval time: Depends on which USCIS service center you applied with
Outcome: Receive greencard.</p>

<h2 id="apply-for-travel-document-and-employment-authorization-i-131-and-i-765">Apply for travel document and employment authorization (I-131 and I-765)</h2>
<p>Because it can take a long time for an ajustment of status to get approved, people usually concurrently apply for travel docuemnt and employment authorization at the same time. These documents are faster to get, and when combined together, provide almost all the benefits of holding a greencard ‚Äì providing the freedom while you wait for I-485 approval.</p>

<p>Approval time: Depends on which USCIS service center you applied with
Outcome: Be able to travel freely and work for whoever you want</p>

<h1 id="advice">Advice</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Generally it is better to put on a strong showing for fewer (typically four or five) criteria, than trying to do more but less well.</li>
  <li>If you have a previously accepted I-140 from a lower preference (EB2 or EB3), you can use that date to accelerate your EB1 if your country is not current.</li>
  <li>It really helps to have access to famous people: senior executives, well-known professionals in your field, professors, public figures, etc. Cultivate these relationships early.</li>
  <li>If you don‚Äôt already clearly meet these criteria, plan for one to two years to go meet them.</li>
  <li>Get your letters on official letterhead, even if it‚Äôs not technically required. It can be a cause of RFE. In a pinch a ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù letterhead could do.</li>
  <li>If your EB1 is approved, this means you‚Äôre almost guaranteed to also get approved for the O1 visa, which can be convenient if you need to work in the US while your greencard is processing.</li>
  <li>For people who are very likely to agree to signing a lettr, it is better to pre-write the lettter for them before you even ask if they want to do it. This way, you can immediately give them something to sign once they agree, saving yourself the back and forth from your lead going cold while your legal team works on the letter. You‚Äôll be getting a lot of letters, so this adds up.</li>
  <li>On non-immigrant visas like the TN, it is inadvisable to leave the country from the day you submit your application until you get your travel authorization, even if your application is accepted. This could last anywhere from 6‚Äì8 months. You should plan ahead for this.</li>
  <li>The country of the greencard applicant is not based on their citizenship, but place of birth. A British citizen born in India is Indian from this perspective.</li>
  <li>Spouses also get a greencard if you file together (?)</li>
  <li>When challenging an RFE, it is best to also respond to the request, even if unreasonable, as a show of good faith.</li>
  <li>USCIS publishes a <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-2#footnote-4">policy manual</a> with detailed explanation of how adjudicatprs should think about EB1 eligibility, and references specific articles of law. It‚Äôs helpful further reading.</li>

<p>This is part one of two posts I‚Äôm writing on immigration. In this first part, I‚Äôm going do my best to document what it was like to apply for an employment-based green card in the most clear and helpful way I can, and share the lessons I‚Äôve learned along the way. My own process started when I read a similar blog post by Julian almost three years ago, so I‚Äôm trying to pay this forward.</p>

<p>I have a lot of feelings about this process, but I‚Äôll be saving those for the second part, where I‚Äôll go more in depth about the price we all pay for the bad employment policy, and what we can do to fix this.</p>
