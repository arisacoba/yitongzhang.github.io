<p><a href="zkga.me">Dark forest</a> is vast. But I didn‚Äôt know that at first, busy as I was, claiming all celestial bodies in sight. But space had a way of quickly teaching you its lessons. <!--more--></p>

<p>The issue I ran into was the fog of war. With my laptop‚Äôs paltry 600 hashes/sec, I quickly ran out of planets to claim. I had to find a way increase my exploration speed. First, I let dark forest use all the cores in my CPU with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">df.setMinerCores(6)</code>, which gave me a nice 6x boost to 2400 hashes/sec, but even that was not sufficient, so I set up a most efficient rust miner on my machine with <a href="https://github.com/projectsophon/darkforest-rs/tree/main/mimc-fast">mimi-fast</a> and <a href="https://github.com/darkforest-eth/plugins/tree/master/content/productivity/remote-explore">remote explore</a>, which brought me to a nice 6000 hashes/sec. This gave me far more plants in sight than I knew what to do with, which is what lead me to the <a href="https://github.com/darkforest-eth/plugins/blob/master/content/productivity/crawl-planets/plugin.js">crawl planets plugin</a>. It‚Äôs not very smart, but sure helps cover ground quickly.</p>

<p>Not soon after, I met my two neighbours: jimjim_eth in yellow and 0xe985cb1f0a06ec400a3d4fcdb4b1eee9d01c3f9c in purple, the latter of whom will henceforth be knwon as 0xe98 for short. Jimjim controls few astral bodies, but they‚Äôre all highly valuable. 0xe98 is the opposite: controlling most bodies in his sector, indiscriminate of value, most likely through the use of the . I can tell because I‚Äôve been using the same tool, and the shape of his holding looks much like mine.</p>

<p>At first, I was threatened by the discovery of two neighbouring civilizations so close by, but after examining their silver withdrawals on the global leaderboard, I was reassured to find that they were roughly in the same order of magnitude in power as me. I have no desire to fight them, but if I had to, I‚Äôm comforted my the thought that it wouldn‚Äôt be totally one-sided.</p>

<p>With my growing holdings (which I refuse to call an empire, because my people deserve a better governance system, but that‚Äôs for later), it‚Äôs becoming more difficult to efficiently funnel my silver to space time tears. I could try to set up a transfer routine, but that won‚Äôt get me too much further. And unfortunately, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúwithdraw silver plugin‚Äù, so that leaves me with no choice but to write my own.</p>

<p>If my neighbours don‚Äôt destroy me between now and the next log, these will be my action items:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write an auto silver withdrawal plugin</li>
  <li>Increase my exploration hashrate with a remote server.</li>
</ol>
