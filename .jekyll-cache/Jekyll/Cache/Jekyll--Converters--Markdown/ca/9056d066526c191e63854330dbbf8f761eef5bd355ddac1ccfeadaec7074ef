<p>Itâ€™s beenâ€¦ uh nine months since the last update on this siteâ€™s open redesign progress, and Iâ€™ve finally gotten around to some some bug fixes<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="fixing-some-long-overdue-issues">Fixing some long overdue issues</h2>
<p>Can you believe this site didnâ€™t work on mobile this entire time? I mean, I started the design with almost no layout, relying mostly on basic typography to create hierachy, so I thought the mobile would be usable enough I could come back and update it later. Turns out, I forgot to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code> to the head because who knew jekyll would initialize the boiler without? Anyway, thatâ€™s fixed.</p>

<p>The other embarassing that I forgot is to set up analytics. Turns out, only the events fired from my hidden archival site were making it through to Google Analytics. Thatâ€™s fixed too.</p>

<p>Lastly, I cleaned up the date formatting on this site so that itâ€™s always: date + month spelled out + last two letters of year (e.g. 03 mar 21), which I like for being unambiguous for non-US readers. You can also drop the date and itâ€™s still readable.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-pass-at-typography">A quick pass at typography</h2>
<p>One cool thing about re-using a font youâ€™ve already purchased is that you can have a font that you like, for free! Yay! Thatâ€™s probably the only cool thing, because itâ€™s all downhill from here.</p>

<p>While Colfax slightly furistic yet friendly geometry served me well on the <a href="http://flowchart.design/">Autoflow marketing page</a>, itâ€™s not particularly ergonomic for text-heavy sites. The jump between regular and medium is pretty aggresive. Iâ€™ve seen this issue with Graphik too. You can manage by either sticking mostly to regular, or just build that thick medium into your design, which I donâ€™t want to.</p>

<p>For now, I settled on a hacky compromise between the two approaches: using mostly regular, while subtly boosting my titles like such to give them just a little bit of weight, like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">h2{-webkit-text-stroke:0.4px; letter-spacing: 0.02rem;}</code> Iâ€™m not particularly proud of it, but itâ€™ll tide me over while I look for a real type solution.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">Whatâ€™s next</h2>
<p>My big goal is to land on a good type system for the site. Iâ€™m eager to try a serif for the body, play around with some of the weird stuff from <a href="https://www.futurefonts.xyz/">Future Fonts</a>, and try to develop a multi-typeface site. But really, Iâ€™m ready to read Bethany Heckâ€™s <a href="https://www.futurefonts.xyz/">Font Review Journal</a></p>

<p>Itâ€™s been fun</p>
