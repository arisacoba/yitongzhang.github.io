I"_<p>I’m not a lawyer, just a crafty guy who’s had a lot of personal experience with immigration. When I was seven, my family moved to Canada (with permanent residency) and became citizens in my early teens. After college, I filed my own TN-1 for my first job in San Francisco, then filed another for my second job. Greencard-wise, I’ve filed two applications concurrently: an EB3 with my employer and an EB1 with a private immigration firm.</p>
