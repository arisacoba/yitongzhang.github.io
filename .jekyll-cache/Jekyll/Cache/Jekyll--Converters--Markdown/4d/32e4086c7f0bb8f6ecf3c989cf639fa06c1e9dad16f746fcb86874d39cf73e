I"=<p>It’s been… uh nine months since the last update on this site’s open redesign progress, and I’ve finally gotten around to some some bug fixes.<!--more--></p>

<p>Can you believe this site didn’t work on mobile this entire time? I mean, I started the design with almost no layout, relying mostly on basic typography to create hierachy, so I thought the mobile would be usable enough I could come back and update it later. Turns out, I forgot to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code> to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code> because who knew jekyll would initialize the boiler without? Anyway, that’s fixed.</p>

<p>The other embarassing that I forgot to set up analytics.</p>

<p>Lastly, I finally cleaned up the date formatting on this site.</p>
