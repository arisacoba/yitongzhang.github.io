I"ó<p><a href="zkga.me">Dark forest</a> space is vast. But I didnâ€™t know that at first, busy as I was, claiming all celestial bodies in sight. But space had a way of quickly teaching you its lessons. <!--more--></p>

<p>The issue I ran into was the fog of war. With my laptopâ€™s paltry 600 hashes/sec, I quickly ran out of planets to claim. I had to find a way increase my exploration speed. First, I let dark forest use all the cores in my CPU with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">df.setMinerCores(6)</code>, which gave me a nice 6x boost to 2400 hashes/sec, but even that was not sufficient, so I set up a most efficient rust miner on my machine with <a href="https://github.com/projectsophon/darkforest-rs/tree/main/mimc-fast">mimi-fast</a> and <a href="https://github.com/darkforest-eth/plugins/tree/master/content/productivity/remote-explore">remote explore</a>, which brought me to a nice 6000 hashes/sec. This gave me far more plants in sight than I knew what to do with.</p>

<p>In the depths of space, I met my two neighbours: jimjim_eth in yellow and 0xe985cb1f0a06ec400a3d4fcdb4b1eee9d01c3f9c in purple, the latter of whom will henceforth be knwon as 0xe98 for short. Jimjim controls few astral bodies, but theyâ€™re all highly valuable. 0xe98 is the opposite: controlling most bodies in his sector, indiscriminate of value, most likely through the use of the <a href="https://github.com/darkforest-eth/plugins/blob/master/content/productivity/crawl-planets/plugin.js">crawl planets plugin</a>. I can tell because Iâ€™ve been using the same tool, and the shape of his holding looks much like mine.</p>

<p>At first, I was threatened by the discovery of two neighbouring civilizations so close by, but after examining their silver withdrawals on the global leaderboard, I was reassured to find that they were roughly in the same order of magnitude in power as me. I have no desire to fight them, but if I had to, Iâ€™m comforted my the thought that it wouldnâ€™t be totally one-sided.</p>

<p>For now,</p>
