I"3	<p>To my future therapist,</p>

<p>For as long as I remember, I’ve derived a lot of my force of will from negativity. Feeling not smart enough, watching my peers be more successful, not having gone to a famous college<!--more-->, having done a professional bootcamp, competing with coworkers (secretly), being an alien in an anti-immigrant country, and a million other nothings that find their way on my shoulder and stay there to become chips.</p>

<p>My closest friends are also the same – absurdly driven because of that chip. One of them almost comically so. The guy had a blue light lamp on his desk pointed to his face to keep him awake so he can work longer hours. (Love you Mike, but you’re gonna die young) Maybe this is a Canadian thing. Always being in the shadow of the US can really give you a complex.</p>

<p>I’ve always know that this was unhealthy. Obviously, wouldn’t it be nice if I could have the same drive to do things, but also be more happy? Of course I’d want to change this. But it’s hard for several reasons.</p>

<p>Most obviously, this negativity fuel really <em>works</em>. I’m a high level designer at pretty famous tech company in silicon valley where I work daily with people whose work I grew up looking up to – something younger Yitong thought only the most elite of the elite could do.</p>

<p>Then there’s the fact that being willfull is part of my identity. It feels risky to mess with the source of that will. What if in doing away with the negativity, I also lose some of the drive? Would I even want to be happier, but less willful?</p>

<p>Of course, there’s the guilt that I feel when I try to think too deeply about this. Even as I’m writing this, I can hear inner voice saying “do you think [insert successful friend] is wasting time on thoughts like this? They’re working on their next accomplishment while you’re whallowing in self-doubt. Move on already!”</p>

<p>And this last one is silly, but I just can’t get over the aesthetics of the solution space: the orientalist worship of meditation, productivity-guru-ism (Tim Ferris) or straight up guru-ism (naval).</p>

<p>Maybe it’s because we’re now on month six of the quarantine, or maybe it’s because I’ve been feeling listless too many Fridays in a row, or maybe it’s that work can no longer distract me</p>
