I"<p>I haven’t update my personal website since… late 2017 – probably the longest period ever between two redesigns. It’s held up fairly well over the last 4 years, but it’s time for the next chapter. There motivators for this latest effort. First, I’m writing more so I’d like a blog-first design, something that can be a permanent home for my thoughts on the internet for decades to come. Second, I’m itching to write more code lately, and Jekyll is a pretty low friction way of getting back into. Lastly, I’ve been toying around with the idea of building a Notion-driven Jekyll competitor, so I figured that before embarking on that, I’d make at least a serious attempt at building something on Jekyll to see where it performs well and where it falls short.</p>
