I"C<p>I think a software-enabled immigration law firm would be a great business. <!--more--></p>

<p>I’m not a lawyer, just a tech person who’s had a lot of personal experience with immigration. When I was seven, my family moved to Canada, where we became citizens a few years later. After college, I filed my own TN for my first job in San Francisco, then filed another TN for my second job. Greencard-wise, I’ve filed two applications concurrently: an EB3 with my employer and an EB1 with a private immigration firm.</p>

<p>Based on these experiences, <em>my core insight is that immigration law is actually very little law</em>, and mostly ops. In fact, more than 90% of the human hours involved are spent on non lawyering activities like: completing forms, gathering support material, sending and responding information requests, filling out templates, etc. And these are all activities we know how to scale with software.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-just-sell-the-software">Why not just sell the software?</h2>
<p>Isn’t a pure play software model more profitable? Yes, but nobody is buying because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Law firms hate new software. I mean, have you ever tried to get them to use Google docs instead of .docx files?</li>
  <li>If it works, they have to fire a lot of their staff, requiring disruptive org change.</li>
</ol>

<p>The obvious objection is that several companies have tried the software-enhanced service firm and failed, Atrium being most top of mind. We’ll dive into comparable companies in detail later, but I think the key lessons are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Prefer software &gt; ops &gt; law, even at the cost of growth: This forces discipline because once you scale up the org, it’s hard to reverse. Legal should only ever do legal strategy and final review. Everything else is at first ops, then moving to software.</li>
  <li>Stick strictly to the grunt work: doing the same rote thing over and over is automatable. Doing a bunch different things is not.</li>
  <li>Don’t burn out: afaik a big reason Atrium didn’t work is that Justin Khan burned out.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="products">Products</h2>
<p>Start with most common types of visas and greencards:</p>

<p>Tier one: pure ops
Visas: L1, H1-B, TN, E3</p>

<p>These are high volume, low legal work, and something most companies have to deal with this</p>

<p>Greencards: EB3 and EB2</p>

<p>Tier two: proof required</p>

<p>Visas: O1, E2</p>

<p>Greencards: EB1, EB5</p>

<p>Tier three: other kinds of legal service</p>

Friendly US person as a service: They join as your cofounder and hold the ability to fire you so you can get EB2 visa</p>
