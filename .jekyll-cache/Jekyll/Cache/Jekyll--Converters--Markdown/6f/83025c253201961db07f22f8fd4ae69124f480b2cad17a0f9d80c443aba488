I"u<p>I think a software-enabled immigration law firm would be a great business.</p>

<p>I’m not a lawyer, just a tech person who’s had a lot of personal experience with immigration. When I was seven, my family moved to Canada (with permanent residency) and became citizens a few years later. After college, I filed my own TN for my first job in San Francisco, then filed another TN for my second job. Greencard-wise, I’ve filed two applications concurrently: an EB3 with my employer and an EB1 with a private immigration firm.</p>

<p>Based on these experiences, my core insight is that immigration law is actually very little law, and mostly ops. In fact, more than 90% of the human hours involved are spent on non lawyering activities like: completing forms, gathering support material, sending and responding information requests, filling out templates, etc. And these are all activities we know how to scale with software.</p>
