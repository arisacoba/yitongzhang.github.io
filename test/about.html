				<h1>Why work on seeing and interacting with complex systems?</h1>
				<h2>The world is getting too complicated for our mammal brain</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Our intuitions about how the world works are failing us because our environment is becoming more complex. As more industries are eaten up by software, we will see them all fall to the laws of software: explosion of data and emergent unpredictable behaviours</p>
			
			<p>We are not mentally equipped to process a the sheer quantity of information — much of which might be fake or inaccurate — we are required to just to get by day to day life. In order to be an informated actor, we are required to consult more sources, evaluate their worth and draw conclusions at a rate that far outpaces most people's media literacy. The only way to keep up is to develop better tools for processing information that extends our mental abilities with software.</p>

			<p>On top of that, the world is inceasingly governed by exponential relationships instead of additive ones. Stock markets, venture capital, disease spreads, social networks, labour relations, are just a few to start.</p>

			<p>This is why in SV, people often talk about changes in orders of magnitude. It is really hard for us to grasp the speed and magnitude of these kinds of movements intuitively. And with more and more loops influencing each other and giving rise to more complex and unpredictible behaviours, we need better tools to help us see, interact and act on with these systems.</p>

			<p>Thankfully, many brillant people are already working in this area. Together, they present absolutely brillant <a href="http://longnow.org/seminars/02017/aug/07/seeing-whole-systems/" target="_blank">talks</a>, <a href="">papers</a>, <a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/" target="blank">demos</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74034.Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death" target="_blank">books</a> and <a href="http://ncase.me/loopy/" target="_blank">prototypes</a> that offer potential solutions. My goal is to turn these ideas into useful products for millions for people.</p>

				<h1>Why are you a designer?</h1>
				<h2>I wanted to be either a capitalist and an artist. Design was a good compromise.</h2>
			</div>
			

			<p>Like most immigrant children, I was expected to be a doctor or a lawyer. In my teenage rebellion, I decided instead to throw myself into the world of literature, philosophy and art. I read everything from Ayn Rand to Albert Camus, made art, and debated politics with the theatre kids.</p>

			<p>When the time for college came, I decided to follow the footsteps of my literary heroes by becoming a capitalist and an artist. The latter never happened (though not for lack of <a href="https://amb-1.com/24870565" target="_blank">trying</a>), but I did end up going to business school.</p>

			<p>Once there, I tried to make good on becoming a capitalist by founding a startup. We lived like cockroaches: sleeping in an unheated basement, working late into wee hours of morning, eating instant noodles. For a while, we had great traction, but eventually we folded the company as our life goals diverged.</p>

			<p>Through this experience, I developed a real taste for end to end product development that has shaped my practice of design to this day. In fact, as an ex-founder, I believe that the best products are made by people who are willing and able to work at whatever level is necessary to iterate towards a better solution. Good design starts at the codebase and permeates all the way to sales and customer support.</p>

			<div class="titleGroup">
				<h1>Who are you outside of work?</h1>
			</div>
			<p>Outside of work, I’m into outdoorsy stuff. I bike everyday and try to rock climb a few times a week. When I get the chance, I also love to hike.</p>

			<p>I’m also a pop culture nerd. I love talking about movies, boardgames, TV, video games, and all forms of narrative media. In fact, I make good conversation everything except football and baseball.</p>

			<p>I guess I can also be a bit of a homebody. I tend a beautiful vegetable garden with which I make delicious dinners for my wonderful roommmates.</p>
