		<h1>The challenge</h1>

		<p>Smart device makers promise a better, more convenient home. But the proliferation of different device makers, apps and interfaces has only made the connected home more complicated to manage. My team was challenged to design a solution to bring fulfill the smart home's promise of simplicity.</p>

		<h1 id="section1">Research and problem definition</h1>

		<p>Having only 6 weeks part-time to complete the project, we our first priority was to aggressively narrow the scope of our app. By the numbers of features in control, we would have the time to work on multiple iterations.</p>

		<p>To do this, we talked to different kinds of home owners to find one that had a profile suitable for a small-scope app. After a few conversations, we managed to eliminated some red-herring user types like the Gadget Geek and Work Warriors.<label for="sn-other-persona" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-other-persona" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote alternate">Although interesting for their high disposable income and tech-savviness, these uses didn‚Äôt care for a more simple and unified home.</span> What we did find interesting, however, are the following groups:</p>

		<p><span class="attention">Savvy homemakers</span>: people who use tech to make their home life more interesting and to bring their family together.</p>

		<p><span class="attention">Tech-saturated professional</span>: people who work in and own a lot of tech, but are tired of their devices demanding so much their time and attention.</p>

		<p>We ended up choosing the tech-saturated professional because we found it a fascinating challenge to design technology for someone who is tired of technology. Also, given our limited time, getting testing data<label for="sn-user-data" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-user-data" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote alternate">Since our classroom was based out of a coworking space, it was easy to get over 20 users to test and interview.</span> for this user type was going to be much easier.</p>

		<p>To quickly access the data we‚Äôve gathered from our research, we created a persona and problem statement.</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="img/personas.png" alt="2 potential personas">
		</figure>
		
		<p>In the same vein, we also created 4 guiding design principles to act as fence posts for our design exploration.</p>

		<div class="">
		<li><span class="attention">Utilitarian</span>: John views his devices as tools, not toys. Our app should reflect that.</li>

		<li><span class="attention">Intrude only when important</span>: John is inundated with notifications. Our app should not exacerbate that. </li>

		<li><span class="attention">Anticipate, don‚Äôt ask</span>: John is tired of micromanaging his tech. Our app works for the user, not the reverse. </li>

		<li><span class="attention">Accessible on the go</span>: John‚Äôs always on the go. Our app accounts for divided attention.</li>
		</div>

		<h1 id="section2">Generating rough concepts</h1>

		<p>To get both conceptual and usability feedback, we tested using a mix of paper and Axure prototypes.<label for="sn-paper-axure" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-paper-axure" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote alternate"> The former gave us valuable concept feedback because users could physically move the screens to compare them. The latter gave us good usability feedback thanks to its higher fidelity.</span> prototypes. In two rounds of tests, we tried over a dozen concepts, with the most interesting ones presented below: </p>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="three columns offset-by-three">
				<p class="attention">In-app notifications:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Goal: 2 tiered notifications: system for important things. In app for minor things.</li>

					<li>Result: Almost universally positive feedback from users. üòÑ</li>

					<li>Results: Inconclusive. Some prefered a device-first design for its straightforwardness, while others liked the speed of the function-first design. ü§î</li>

		<div class="mainText six columns offset-by-three">
		<p>The first two concepts were quickly implemented in our final wireframes, but the mixed feedback on the third made it hard to decide on the dashboard design. Because of our limited time<label for="sn-time" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-time" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote alternate">Looking back, a quick user test of just this screen would have taken very little time. But given our inexperience, we just didn't think of testing individual parts of the app.</span>, we chose to move on to the UI phase while generating versions of both dashboard styles to test in the next phase.</p>

		<h1 id="section3">Translating concepts into UI</h1>

		<p>I chose to test the function-first dashboard in my prototype because I believed that for something used as frequently as their home devices, users would prefer something that is quick to use over something clear but more cumbersome.<label for="sn-cumbersome" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-cumbersome" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote alternate"> Just like snapchat, my theory our app could be harder to learn if it made a frequently used function really quick to use</span>
		</p>	

		<p>Based on our wireframes , we designed UI concepts that reflect everything we learned thus far. I based my visual explorations mostly on the following:</p>

		<ol>
		<li>The home that our persona would likely own</li>
		<li>Differentiation from competitors</li>
		</ol>
		<figure>
			<img src="img/tempshow1.5.png" alt="different UI concepts">
		</figure>

		<p>Among all the UI concepts I developed, I chose to move forward with the style that, according to users, ‚Äúfelt most like a traditional app‚Äù<label for="sn-traditional" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-traditional" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote alternate">In our test, users felt more at ease navigating the green version thanks to the familiar top nav bar and tile design.</span> because I did not want to overwhelm the user with both an unfamiliar UI and a unfamiliar dashboard design.</p>

		<h1>Testing different UI implementations</h1>

		<p>While we got a lot of feedback on different UI parts, our primary concern was to test the function vs. device based dashboard</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="img/tempshow1.6.png" alt="different UI concepts">
		</figure>

		<p>After 7 interviews, many flaws in the functional approach came to light, with the following 2 being the most salient:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Hi-fi animations were needed to convey how many of the non-standard interactions would work<label for="sn-cumbersome" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-cumbersome" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote alternate">Without animation, there isn't a clear sense that the yellow would fill in, therefore making its use as a progress indicator confusing.<img src="img/animation.gif" alt=""></span></li>

		<li>Users think about their home in term of what objects they own, not what functions their objects afford.<label for="sn-mismatch" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-mismatch" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote alternate">In retrospect, some of this problem could have been mitigated with a better onboarding that taught users how the app worked.</span></li>
		</ol>
		<p>For all these reasons and more, this concept was discarded. Instead, we used our teammate Preunky‚Äôs device-driven concept, which mapped well to our users‚Äô mental model, thanks to the simple carousel of devices and use of iOS-settings-like toggles.</p>

		<p>Based on this design, we added back parts of the discarded prototype that tested well, such as:</p>

		<p><span class="attention">Top placement of modes:</span> as the bottom nav and mode toggle were both often used features, seperating them would prevent some fat finger errors.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="img/modeToggle.png" alt="mode toggle evolution">
		</figure>
		

		<p><span class="attention">Setting groups:</span>expanding the group concept from modes to settings allowed users to make better use if their advanced settings.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="img/settingGroup.png" alt="setting group evolution">
		</figure>

		<p><span class="attention">Better integrated status display:</span>Using the device icon itself to display the status was both a delightful touch and a space saver.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="img/deviceStatus.png" alt="device status evolution">
		</figure>

		<p>Combining the best aspects of each prototype into a device centric framework, we developed the screens that comprised BUNDL's final design.</p>

	<div class="mainText six columns offset-by-three">
		<h1 id="section4">What I've learned</h1>

		<p>This project really helped me appreaciate the importance of understaning our users' mental model. Even if it a design is technically faster, it may still feel harder to use if it does not behave as the user expects.</p>

		<p>Looking back, there were many things I could have done to bridge the gap. For example, I could have leveraged the onboarding process to not only introduce features, but also the mental model. In the same vein, I could have used <a href="http://layervault.tumblr.com/post/42361566927/progressive-reduction">progressive reduction principles</a> to gradually fade away the device while simulatenously bringing forward its functions. The list goes on.</p>

		<p>On a broader level, I've become more adept at testing concepts using the right prototyping tool and at the right fidelity. For example, I've learned to use scrappy wireframes to isolate UX from UI testing and animations to show more complex interactions. </p>

		<p>Finally, given more time, I would have liked to consider the limitations of technology more in our designs. In fact, our concept detected devices via bluetooth and wifi when this is not actually possible. If we ever wanted to make BUNDL a real app, we'd have to find an alternate solution.</p>
