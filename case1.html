		<h1 id="section1">The challenge</h1>

		<p>Smart device makers promise a better, more convenient home. But the proliferation of different device makers, apps and interfaces has only made the connected home more complicated to manage. My team was challenged to design a solution to bring fulfill the smart home's promise of simplicity.</p>

		<h1 id="section2">Narrowing down the scope</h1>

		<p>Since we only had 6 weeks part-time to complete the challenge, we aggressively focused the scope of our app so that we could iterate as many times as possible over a small number of features. </p>

		<p>To narrow things down, we talked to different kinds of home owners to find one that had a profile suitable for a small-scope app. After a few conversations, we eliminated some red-herring user types like the Gadget Geek and Work Warriors.<label for="sn-other-persona" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-other-persona" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Although interesting for their high disposable income and tech-savviness, these uses didn‚Äôt care for a more simple and unified home.</span>

		What we did find interesting, however, are the following groups</p>

		<p>Savvy homemakers: people who use tech to make their home life more interesting and to bring their family together.</p>

		<p>Tech-saturated professional: people who work in and own a lot of tech, but are tired of their devices demanding so much their time and attention.</p>

		<p>In the end, we chose the tech-saturated professional because we found it a fascinating challenge to design technology for someone who is tired of technology. Also given our limited time, getting testing data<label for="sn-user-data" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-user-data" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ended up with 20+ user tests done because every person in our coworking space fit the mould</span>

		for this user type was going to be much easier.</p>

		<p>To quickly access the data we‚Äôve gathered from our research, we created a persona and problem statement.</p>

		<p>[insert persona card + problem statement]</p>

		<p>In order to keep our solution relevant to the tech-saturated professional, we created 5 guiding principles to act as fence posts for our design exploration space</p>

		<p>Utilitarian: John views his devices as tools, not toys. Our app should reflect that.</p>

		<p>Intrude only when important: John is inundated with notifications. Our app should not exacerbate that. </p>

		<p>Anticipate, don‚Äôt ask: John is tired of micromanaging his tech. Our app works for the user, not the reverse. </p>

		<p>Accessible on the go: John‚Äôs always on the go. Our app accounts for divided attention.</p>

		<h1 id="section3">Generating rough concepts</h1>

		<p>To get both conceptual and usability feedback, we tested using a mix of paper and Axure<label for="sn-paper-axure" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-paper-axure" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> Using paper gave us valuable concept feedback because users could physically spread out the screens to compare and contrast them. Axure, on the other hand, gave us good usability feedback thanks to its higher fidelity.</span>

	 	prototypes. In two rounds of tests, we tried over a dozen concepts, with the most interesting ones presented below: </p>

		<p>Based on Intrude only when important - In-app notifications:</p>

		<p>Goal: 2 tiered notifications: system for important things. In app for minor things.</p>

		<p>Result: Almost universally positive feedback from users. üòÑ</p>

		<p>Based on ‚Äúanticipate, don‚Äôt ask‚Äù - Function groups:</p>

		<p>Which and how principle was used: </p>

		<p>Goal: Group many device functions into categories that match our users‚Äô daily schedule to reduce steps needed to adjust their home.</p>

		<p>Result: Users loved it, but wanted to see what was being changed every time. üôÇ</p>

		<p>Based on easily accessible on the go - function-first dashboard</p>

		<p>Goal: Reduce clicks needed access device functions by bringing functions out of their devices and directly into the main screen</p>

		<p>Results: Inconclusive. Some prefered a device-first design for its straightforwardness, while others liked the speed of the function-first design. ü§î</p>
		
		<p>The first two concepts were quickly implemented in our final wireframes, but the mixed feedback made it hard to decide on the dashboard design.Therefore, we chose to move on to the UI phase while generating versions of both dashboard styles to test.</p>

		<h1 id="section4">Translating concepts into UI</h1>

		<p>I chose to test the function-first dashboard in my prototype because I believed that for something used as frequently as their home-toggles, users would prefer something that was quick to use over something clear but more cumbersome.<label for="sn-cumbersome" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-cumbersome" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> Just like snapchat, I thought our app could be harder to learn if it made a frequently used function really quick to use</span>

		</p>	



		<p>Based on our wireframes , we designed UI concepts that reflect everything we learned thus far. I based my visual explorations mostly on the following:</p>

		<ol>
		<li>The home that our persona would likely own</li>
		<li>Differentiation from competitors</li>
		</ol>

		<p>[carousel, with chosen UI first and other discarded UIs later]</p>

		<a href="test.com">ALLAAmong all the UI concepts I developed, I chose to move forward with the style that, according to users, ‚Äúfelt most like a traditional app‚Äù</a>

		<p>Among all the UI concepts I developed, I chose to move forward with the style that, according to users, ‚Äúfelt most like a traditional app‚Äù because I did not want to overwhelm the user with both an unfamiliar UI and a unfamiliar dashboard design.</p>

		<h1>Testing different UI implementations</h1>

		<p>While we got a lot of feedback on different UI parts, our primary concern was to test the function vs. device based dashboard</p>

		<p>[my dashbaord vs preunky‚Äôs dashboard]</p>

		<p>After 7 interviews, many flaws in the functional approach came to light: </p>

		<p>Onboarding did not sufficiently help users switch their thinking from device-centric to function-centric, causing users to be surprised by the options presented on the dashboard (show how onboarding can be misinterpreted)</p>

		<p>Hi-fi animations were needed to convey how many of the non-standard interactions would work (show how confusing no animation is)</p>

		<p>Mismatch with users‚Äô mental model. Users think about their home in term of what objects they own, not what functions their objects afford.</p>

		<p>For all these reasons and more, this concept was discarded. However, we used our teammate Preunky‚Äôs device-driven concept, which mapped well to our users‚Äô mental model, thanks to the simple carousel of devices and use of iOS-settings-like toggles.</p>

		<p>Based on this design, we added back parts of the discarded prototype that tested well.</p>

		<p>Prominent placement of modes</p>

		<p>[my original design, Preunky‚Äôs design, merged final design using best of both]</p>

		<p>Icon set</p>

		<p>[my original design, Preunky‚Äôs design, merged final design using best of both]</p>

		<p>Setting slider</p>

		<p>[my original design, Preunky‚Äôs design, merged final design using best of both]</p>

		<p>Device status display</p>

		<p>[my original design, Preunky‚Äôs design, merged final design using best of both]</p>

		<p>In our final design, </p>

		<h1 id="section5">Takeaways</h1>

		<p>Onboarding can be used not only for features, but mental model</p>

		<p>Use progressive reduction to move from obj oriented to functional</p>

		<p>Use the right prototyping tool</p>

		<p>Separate UI/UX testing</p>

		<h2>Had we had more time‚Ä¶</h2>

		<p>A more specific problem statement</p>

		<p>Thankfully we had a keen awareness of persona, but had our problem been more specific, we would have come up with a solution more laser focused on his needs.</p>

		<p>Design for technical limitations</p>

		<p>Adding devices is a crucial part of a an app that purports to unify devices. We had explicit instruction to ignore this part, but if the app were real, this part would need more thought.</p>

		<p>Anticipate more, ask less</p>

		<p>We could have pushed the anticipation further. A lot of our efforts failed due to shoddy execution, not inherent fault. e.g. setting toggles. e.g. pulldown menu toggle. </p>
