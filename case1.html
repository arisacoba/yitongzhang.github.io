		<h1>The challenge</h1>

		<p>Smart device makers promise a better, more convenient home. But the proliferation of different device makers, apps and interfaces has only made the connected home more complicated to manage. My team was challenged to design a solution to bring fulfill the smart home's promise of simplicity.</p>

		<h1 id="section1">Research and problem definition</h1>

		<p>Having only 6 weeks part-time to complete the project, we our first priority was to aggressively narrow the scope of our app. By the numbers of features in control, we would have the time to work on multiple iterations.</p>

		<p>To do this, we talked to different kinds of home owners to find one that had a profile suitable for a small-scope app. After a few conversations, we managed to eliminated some red-herring user types like the Gadget Geek and Work Warriors.<label for="sn-other-persona" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-other-persona" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Although interesting for their high disposable income and tech-savviness, these uses didn‚Äôt care for a more simple and unified home.</span> What we did find interesting, however, are the following groups:</p>

		<p>Savvy homemakers: people who use tech to make their home life more interesting and to bring their family together.</p>

		<p>Tech-saturated professional: people who work in and own a lot of tech, but are tired of their devices demanding so much their time and attention.</p>

		<p>We ended up choosing the tech-saturated professional because we found it a fascinating challenge to design technology for someone who is tired of technology. Also, given our limited time, getting testing data<label for="sn-user-data" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-user-data" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Since our classroom was based out of a coworking space, it was easy to get over 20 users to test and interview.</span> for this user type was going to be much easier.</p>

		<p>To quickly access the data we‚Äôve gathered from our research, we created a persona and problem statement.</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="img/personas.png" alt="2 potential personas">
		</figure>
		
		<p>In the same vein, we also created 4 guiding design principles to act as fence posts for our design exploration.</p>

		<div class="">
		<li><span class="attention">Utilitarian</span>: John views his devices as tools, not toys. Our app should reflect that.</li>

		<li><span class="attention">Intrude only when important</span>: John is inundated with notifications. Our app should not exacerbate that. </li>

		<li><span class="attention">Anticipate, don‚Äôt ask</span>: John is tired of micromanaging his tech. Our app works for the user, not the reverse. </li>

		<li><span class="attention">Accessible on the go</span>: John‚Äôs always on the go. Our app accounts for divided attention.</li>
		</div>

		<h1 id="section2">Generating rough concepts</h1>

		<p>To get both conceptual and usability feedback, we tested using a mix of paper and Axure prototypes.<label for="sn-paper-axure" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-paper-axure" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> The former gave us valuable concept feedback because users could physically move the screens to compare them. The latter gave us good usability feedback thanks to its higher fidelity.</span> prototypes. In two rounds of tests, we tried over a dozen concepts, with the most interesting ones presented below: </p>

		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="four columns offset-by-one">
				<p>In-app notifications:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Goal: 2 tiered notifications: system for important things. In app for minor things.</li>
					<li>Principle: Based on Intrude only when important.</li>
					<li>Result: Almost universally positive feedback from users. üòÑ</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Function groups</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Goal: Group many device functions into categories that match our users‚Äô daily schedule to reduce steps needed to adjust their home.</li>
					<li>Principle: Based on ‚Äúanticipate, don‚Äôt ask‚Äù</li>
					<li>Result: Users loved it, but wanted to see what was being changed every time. üôÇ</li>

				<p>Function-first dashboard</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Goal: Reduce clicks needed access device functions by bringing functions out of their devices and directly into the main screen</li>
					<li>Principle: Based on easily accessible on the go</li>
					<li>Results: Inconclusive. Some prefered a device-first design for its straightforwardness, while others liked the speed of the function-first design. ü§î</li>

		<div class="mainText seven columns offset-by-one">
		<p>The first two concepts were quickly implemented in our final wireframes, but the mixed feedback on the third made it hard to decide on the dashboard design. Because of our limited time<label for="sn-time" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-time" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Looking back, a quick user test of just this screen would have taken very little time. But given our inexperience, we just didn't think of testing individual parts of the app.</span>, we chose to move on to the UI phase while generating versions of both dashboard styles to test in the next phase.</p>

		<h1 id="section3">Translating concepts into UI</h1>

		<p>I chose to test the function-first dashboard in my prototype because I believed that for something used as frequently as their home devices, users would prefer something that is quick to use over something clear but more cumbersome.<label for="sn-cumbersome" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-cumbersome" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> Just like snapchat, my theory our app could be harder to learn if it made a frequently used function really quick to use</span>
		</p>	

		<p>Based on our wireframes , we designed UI concepts that reflect everything we learned thus far. I based my visual explorations mostly on the following:</p>

		<ol>
		<li>The home that our persona would likely own</li>
		<li>Differentiation from competitors</li>
		</ol>
		<figure>
			<img src="img/tempshow1.5.png" alt="different UI concepts">
		</figure>

		<p>Among all the UI concepts I developed, I chose to move forward with the style that, according to users, ‚Äúfelt most like a traditional app‚Äù because I did not want to overwhelm the user with both an unfamiliar UI and a unfamiliar dashboard design.</p>

		<h1>Testing different UI implementations</h1>

		<p>While we got a lot of feedback on different UI parts, our primary concern was to test the function vs. device based dashboard</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="img/tempshow1.6.png" alt="different UI concepts">
		</figure>

		<p>After 7 interviews, many flaws in the functional approach came to light: </p>
		<ul>
		<li>Onboarding did not sufficiently help users switch their thinking from device-centric to function-centric, causing users to be surprised by the options presented on the dashboard (show how onboarding can be misinterpreted)</li>

		<li>Hi-fi animations were needed to convey how many of the non-standard interactions would work<label for="sn-cumbersome" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-cumbersome" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Without animation, there isn't a clear sense that the yellow would fill in, therefore making its use as a progress indicator confusing.<img src="img/animation.gif" alt=""></span></li>

		<li>Mismatch with users‚Äô mental model. Users think about their home in term of what objects they own, not what functions their objects afford.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For all these reasons and more, this concept was discarded. However, we used our teammate Preunky‚Äôs device-driven concept, which mapped well to our users‚Äô mental model, thanks to the simple carousel of devices and use of iOS-settings-like toggles.</p>

		<p>Based on this design, we added back parts of the discarded prototype that tested well.</p>

		<h2>Top placement of modes</h2>
		<figure>
			<img src="img/modeToggle.png" alt="mode toggle evolution">
		</figure>
		<p>Maecenas faucibus mollis interdum. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.</p>

		<h2>Setting group</h2>

			<img src="img/settingGroup.png" alt="setting group evolution">
		</figure>
		<p>Maecenas faucibus mollis interdum. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.</p>

		<h2>Device status display</h2>

			<img src="img/deviceStatus.png" alt="device status evolution">
		</figure>
		<p>Maecenas faucibus mollis interdum. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.</p>

		<p>In our final design, </p>

		<h1 id="section4">Takeaways</h1>

		<p>Onboarding can be used not only for features, but mental model</p>

		<p>Use progressive reduction to move from obj oriented to functional</p>

		<p>Use the right prototyping tool</p>

		<p>Separate UI/UX testing</p>

		<h2>Had we had more time‚Ä¶</h2>

		<p>A more specific problem statement</p>

		<p>Thankfully we had a keen awareness of persona, but had our problem been more specific, we would have come up with a solution more laser focused on his needs.</p>

		<p>Design for technical limitations</p>

		<p>Adding devices is a crucial part of a an app that purports to unify devices. We had explicit instruction to ignore this part, but if the app were real, this part would need more thought.</p>

		<p>Anticipate more, ask less</p>

		<p>We could have pushed the anticipation further. A lot of our efforts failed due to shoddy execution, not inherent fault. e.g. setting toggles. e.g. pulldown menu toggle. </p>
