I'm not a lawyer, just a crafty guy who's had a lot of personal experience with immigration. When I was seven, my family moved to Canada (with permanent residency) and became citizens in my early teens. After college, I filed my own TN-1 for my first job in San Francisco, then filed another for my second job. Greencard-wise, I've filed two applications concurrently: an EB3 with my employer and an EB1 with a private immigration firm.

## Replace law with ops


## Scale ops with software


## Growth: Great content

## Growth: Sell to startups

## Growth: Proxy services 
Visa holding pen: Company that employs you while you are thinking about your next thing

Friendly US person as a service: They join as your cofounder and hold the ability to fire you so you can get EB2 visa


## Risks

Market might be moving away


Market size


Family-based immigration much larger


Political uncertainty

## Comparable businesses

Atrium


Do not pay


Onemedical
