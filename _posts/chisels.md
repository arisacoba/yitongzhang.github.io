I've been watching a lot of woodworking and construction Youtube lately, and one subgenre that I've been particularly obsessed with is the workshop tour. A row of ten solid clamps, a few well-honed hand planes, a rack of chisels, neatly arranged on a peg board. Some guy with a beard gently cradling each item in his hands. He shows you how thin of a shaving he can get with his plane. Holds it up against the light like a baker checks their dough for thinness. That's the stuff, and don't have any of it in software.

There's a lot of reasons why, but the one most top of mind for me
