I've been watching a lot of woodworking Youtube lately, and one subgenre that I've been particularly obsessed with is the workshop tour. You can probably picture it: rows of clamps, half a dozen well-honed hand planes, a rack of chisels, small tools neatly arranged on a peg board. There's some guy with a beard gently cradling each item in his hands, telling you how he's had the same plane for as long as his daughter's been alive, and how they just don't make them this well anymore. He makes one clean sweep with the thing, and holds up the shaving against the light to show you how impossibly thin it is. The way it dances in the breeze reminds you of the katsuobushi on those crazy good takoyakis you once had in Osaka.

That's the stuff, and we don't have any of it in software.

All we have are these horrible power tools with 25 attachment heads that don't work well. Five years ago, you find this neat little cloud file sync app that you love. Today, it's grown a productivity suite, upselling you to the business plan every third interaction, and is somehow trying to replace your filesystem. And the story repeats itself over and over: dropbox, invision, google analytics. This is not limited to big companies either: donut is now offering 15 other services. 

Why this happens is complicated, but at least one key reason is founders misjudging their company's fit for venture capital. 

1. Ambition
2. Hiring
3. Competition
4. Boostrapping is hard

I think panic is doing it right: picking products with inheritently limited scope, many products. Basecamp is doing it wrong: going after huge and complex products
