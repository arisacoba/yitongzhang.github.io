I haven't update my personal website since... late 2017 – probably the longest period ever between two redesigns. It's held up fairly well over the last 4 years, but it's time for the next chapter. There motivators for this latest effort. First, I'm writing more so I'd like a blog-first design, something that can be a permanent home for my thoughts on the internet for decades to come. Second, I'm itching to write more code lately, and Jekyll is a pretty low friction way of getting back into. Lastly, I've been toying around with the idea of building a Notion-driven Jekyll competitor, so I figured that before embarking on that, I'd make at least a serious attempt at building something on Jekyll to see where it performs well and where it falls short.  

Something else that I'd like to experiment with is designing this site directly in code. I've done this on some smaller projects before, but never tried it on anything of this level, so it should be fun. I have a general idea of where I'd like to go with the design, but am planning on figuring most of it out as I go. As a result, I expect this site to be pretty janky while it is under construction. 

Matter of fact, I'm going to figure out how to publish the current version, which runs the default [Minima][minima] theme, as soon as I finish this post
