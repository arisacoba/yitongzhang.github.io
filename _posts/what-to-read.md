This seems kinda obvious to me, but people have relatively few original ideas. Most of the time, what seems like new ideas are just mashups of various things we've read. It's like in design: there are no new designs, only interesting remixes.

By this logic it's really important to read the right things, because the reate of new idea generation = what you read * your ability to make interesting mashups.

So what should you read?

1. Things that few people are reading
2. Prefer facts over analysis over opinions
3. Things you don't understand

Number two is especially tough when it comes to history and social sciences because opinions often masquerade as facts
