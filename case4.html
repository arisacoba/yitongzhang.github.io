			To better incorporate type in my design, I need to develop a large working repertoire of fonts in my mind. But memorizing a bunch of fonts is bad because it limits my exploration to the size of my memory and makes me over-reliant on sites like Typewolf and Fonts In Use. To solve this problem, I'm making FontSearch, an app that lets users search Google Fonts not by their name, but by their features.

	<h1>Well-read but still confused</h1>

	<p>For a very long time, I had a hard time integrating type into my design. In an attempt to address this problem, I read Thinking With Type and the Elements of Typographic Style, but was left unsatisfied.</p>

	<p>Although the books did a good job of breaking down what typography was, its history and general classification, I was still unable to leverage it effectively in my work because I still unable to:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>distinguishing a font font from a bad font.</li>
	<li>choose the right font a project.</li>
	<li>make coherent font pairings / systems.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Then I read John Gold’s blog <a href="http://www.jon.gold/2016/05/robot-design-school/">post</a> on teaching type to a design AI and it became clear what I needed to do.</p>

	<p>In it, he breaks down how he taught their system to understand specific font features in order to match them together based on a combination of feature similarity and feature contrast.</p>

	<p>Similarly, if I wanted to effectively use type in my design, I would need to remember a large repertoire of fonts and their features.</p>

	<p>But as a beginner designer, memorizing a large amount of fonts seems like an inefficient way of getting good at typography because:</p>

	<ol>
	<li>Learning a large amount of fonts and their features takes too much time.</li>
	<li>My type exploration will be constrained my working memory.</li>
	<li>We become over-reliant on popular combinations featured on Typewolf and Fonts In Use.<label for="sn-resources" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-resources" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I love Typewolf as a source of beautifully curated inspiration. I'm just advcoating that on top of taking inspiration from others, we should have the tools to think from scratch</span></li>
	</ol>

	<h1>Thinking about type from first principles</h1>

	<p>The solution is to think about typography from first principles, just like a robot would. </p>

	<p>Want a body font? Let’s look at fonts with a complete range weights &amp; styles, a large x-height, open apertures and low contrast.</p>

	<p>Want a display font to match? Try searching for fonts with stronger stroke contrast and lower x-height. But let’s stick with the same double storey “a” and ball endings to tie it together.</p>

	<p>…except you can’t<label for="sn-typekit" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-typekit" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Except on Typekit, which has some rudimentary feature search functionality as of August 2016.</span>. Unless you have an incredibly extensive list of fonts stored in your brain, this kind of thinking about type is very difficult because there’s no easy way to search for fonts by their features.</p>

	<p>Enter FontSearch, an app that lets users search Google Fonts not by their name, but by their features. With this tool, I hope to help designers can fluidly explore fonts and think about pairings logically. </p>

	<p>See a WIP version of the app <a href="http://www.zhayitong.com/fontsearch/">here</a>.</p>

	<h1>Roadmap</h1>

	<p>Currently, I’m working on developing the front-end of the website. My friend is working on tagging some basic font features, namely: x-height, stroke thickness, contrast, stress axe, serif type, serif size and symmetry.</p>

	<p>In the medium term, we’d like to expand on the back-end to include more features like: aperture, terminal shape, specific letter forms, etc. On the front-end, I’d like to build pages like these that highlight directly on a font sample each font’s features.</p>

	<figure>
		<label for="mn-another-screen" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-another-screen" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">A first step would be to display the font feature data in a table. Eventually, I'd like to visually highlight the features like <a href="http://typedetail.com/georgia.html">this</a>.</span>

	<p>In the long run, we’d like to integrate licensed fonts from different foundries to make as complete a database as possible.</p>

	<p>If you’d like to help, let me know!</p>
