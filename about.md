Hi! I'm Yitong, a designer in San Francisco. I grew up in Montreal, Canada â€“ a very cold place my family moved to when I was young. Immigration is a big part of my story. You can listen to me talk about it on [Design Details][dd].

I currently work on design systems at [Coinbase][cb]. I also designed a bunch of the consumer app aka the blue one that most people use.

In my spare time, I like to make things like this Figma plugin called [Autoflow][af], or this marketing page pattern library called [Goodweb.design][gwd], and this vegetable seasonality [website][hf]. The latter two could really use a bit of maintenance. Oh and I also tend to a beautiful [vegetable garden][veg].
